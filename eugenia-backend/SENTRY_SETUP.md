# Sentry Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

## What We Did
1. Created `instrument.js` with Sentry initialization
2. Updated `server.js` to use Sentry's latest Express integration
3. Added your Sentry DSN to `.env`
4. Added a test endpoint at `/debug-sentry`

## Testing Sentry

### 1. Restart Your Server
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C) and restart it
cd eugenia-backend
node server.js
```

### 2. Trigger a Test Error
Visit this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3001/debug-sentry
```

### 3. Check Sentry Dashboard
Go to your Sentry dashboard and you should see:
- Error: "My first Sentry error from Eugenia ISA!"
- Full stack trace
- Request details
- Environment info

## What Gets Tracked
- All unhandled errors
- API endpoint failures
- Queue processing errors
- SMS sending failures
- FUB API errors
- Gemini AI errors

## Error Context
Each error includes:
- User request details
- Stack traces
- Environment variables (excluding secrets)
- Custom tags and context
- Performance data

## Production Tips
1. Set `NODE_ENV=production` in production
2. Consider lowering `tracesSampleRate` to 0.1 (10%) for high traffic
3. Use error boundaries in your React frontend too
4. Set up alerts in Sentry for critical errors

Your error tracking is now active! ðŸš€
