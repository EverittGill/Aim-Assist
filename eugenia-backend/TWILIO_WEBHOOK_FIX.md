# Twilio Webhook Configuration Fix

## The Issue
Twilio is returning its default message instead of calling your webhook. This means the webhook URL isn't properly configured in Twilio Console.

## Fix Instructions

1. **Go to Twilio Console**
   - https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming

2. **Click on your phone number** (+18662981158)

3. **In the "Messaging Configuration" section**, configure:
   - **Configure with:** Webhooks, TwiML Bins, Functions, Studio, or Proxy
   - **A message comes in:** 
     - Webhook: `https://7a17-2601-346-700-b6e7-c12a-4327-3c5d-6814.ngrok-free.app/webhook/twilio-sms`
     - HTTP Method: **POST**
   - **Primary handler fails:** Leave empty
   - **Status callback URL:** Leave empty

4. **IMPORTANT: Scroll down and click the blue "Save configuration" button**

## Common Issues

### If you still get the default message:
1. Make sure you clicked "Save configuration" (easy to miss!)
2. Check that the webhook URL doesn't have any extra spaces
3. Ensure HTTP method is set to POST (not GET)
4. Try refreshing the page and checking if settings saved

### If webhook fails:
- The ngrok URL changes when you restart ngrok
- Current working URL: `https://7a17-2601-346-700-b6e7-c12a-4327-3c5d-6814.ngrok-free.app/webhook/twilio-sms`
- Backend must be running on port 3001

## Test After Configuration
Send a text to +18662981158 and watch your backend console for logs like:
```
=== Incoming SMS Received ===
From: +17068184445
To: +18662981158
Message: [your message]
```
