## Current Safety Status: ‚úÖ PROTECTED

### 1. SMS Service Status
- **Twilio NOT configured** - All SMS functions will fail
- **Production SMS blocked** - Additional code-level protection
- **No accidental messaging possible**

- Always verify recipient numbers before enabling SMS
- Test with your own phone number first

### Code Review Checklist:
